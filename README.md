# Pokémon Dark Gold and Dark Silver ![master workflow](https://github.com/vulcandth/pokedarkgs/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

##### <u>Playability Status:</u> *Still in early development, You are going to have a bad time.*

This is a Rom Hack based on the disassembly of Pokémon Crystal by Pret. I wanted to learn about ROM hacking and assembly, as well as make something fun for my Friends and Family to play. Many of the changes are based on things I wanted from a ROM Hack or my Friends or Family asked for. You are more than welcome to give it a play, suggest changes, and propose code improvements. 



This romhack aims to bring Pokemon Gold/Silver to the Crystal Engine with a few twists. See below for some Planned features.

1. Add most pokemon directly related to the Gen I / II pokemon. (Ex. Baby Pokemon).

2. 16bit Mon ID's 16bit Move ID's. [**Implemented**]

3. Newbox (Bill's PC overhall). [**Implemented**]

4. 60 FPS Doublespeed [**Implemented**]

5. Dynamic Sprite Reload [**Implemented**]

6. 3DS Virtual Console Support [**Implemented**]

7. Rare spawns based on habitat [**Partially Implemented**]

8. Follower Pokemon [**Coming Soon!**]

9. Slightly Increased difficulty

10. New Town/Gym In Lake of Rage

11. Lavendar town rework

12.  ... and More!



You may be asking why is it called "Dark"? Hell if I know. I have a couple ideas about that.. but.. whatever. Feel free to help me discover where this romhack will take us!
